# Information Organization
---
Information organization is the process of making data meaningful by organizing it. Data on it’s own is hard to understand at a glance, and if there are large volumes of data it can only have meaning once it’s chunked, labeled, and shaped into something a user can understand.
 

## When organizing information:
- All information should be easy to locate
- The most important information should be emphasized
- All information should be chunked
- The material should be easy to skim 
- There should be a flow or sequence
