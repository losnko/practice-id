# Labels
Labels act as shortcuts to communicate information efficiently. They are used for guiding readers or users while navigating the site by scanning for the relevant label. If someone wants to find contact information for a business they’ll look for a contact label, if they want to navigate back to the home page they will look for the home button or text, a restaurant webpage will normally have a menu label. Without labels, people would not know where to look. Sites, apps, information blocks, and documents should all have labels as well as any graphics, tables, data visualizations and figures.
 
## Types of labels:
- Contextual Links: Hyperlinked words that go to other pages or other sections of the same page. They should have a clear and simple meaning the user will understand. Can be separate or in a paragraph
 
- Headings: Tells the user what the next section of information will be about
 
- Navigational System Choices: Options to navigate, such as scroll down
 
- Iconic labels: Icons such as a house for the home button
 
- Index Terms: Usually invisible to users, these labels are used in the background of a site or app to make searching or browsing easier. For example, if someone searches for purses, necklaces, or scarves they might all belong to the index term accessories and suggest that page on a clothing site.
