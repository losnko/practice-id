# Information Maps & Templates

An information map is a way of structuring information on a page using two or more information block types. Each block is short, spaced out, and chunked into different sections that contain a single topic with no irrelevant information.
 
Information mapping allows you to transform a wall of text into clear information with road posts (labels) people can skim and look at to digest the information quickly. And any section they wish to learn more about or re-read they can find at a glance.
