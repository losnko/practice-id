# Information Architecture (IA)

We are a group of information designers who collaborated to produce a set of materials with the intention of contributing to the greater design collective through a showcase of skill, knowledge and understanding from within the field.

## The Book & The Digital Companion

The result is a collection of information architecture resources.

While comprehensive enough for a fellow designer, the book serves as an introduction to the topic of information architecture for the brave and curious alike.

Additionally, this website serves a digital companion to the aforementioned material.
