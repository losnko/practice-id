# Information Architecture (IA)

We are a group of information designers who collaborated to produce a set of materials with the intention of contributing to the greater design collective through a showcase of skill, knowledge and understanding from within the field.

## The Book & The Digital Companion

The result is a collection of information architecture resources.

While comprehensive enough for a fellow designer, the book serves as an introduction to the topic of information architecture for the brave and curious alike. The guide walks readers through an introduction to the main principles of information architecture, the framework that should be utilized when structuring information for users, some examples of good and bad information architecture, and links to additional resources for those who wish to learn more.

We hope this guide can help readers recognize how information architecture is utilized in the world around them. And we hope that once readers finish this text theyâ€™ll be able to create documents, websites, and applications that users can easily understand and navigate.

Additionally, this website serves a digital companion to the aforementioned material.
