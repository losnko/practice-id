# Information Types: 
---

The type of information can be distinguished by process, structure concept, principle, fact, and classification. Information types are not necessarily limited to these six categories, as they can be defined as organization systems, labelling systems, navigation systems, and search systems. These, however, refer more so to information structures, rather than systems.

For all intent and purposes, the six main categories are as listed and defined below: 

## Process:
- Refers to a sequence of changes that occur over time, for a specific purpose. It includes the different stages of the process, or a description of how it functions.

## Structure:

- Refers to a physical object, or something that can be separated into parts with physical or identifiable boundaries. 

## Concept:

- Refers to a group of physical objects, conditions, relations, events, or ideas that share a unique combination of attributes not shared by other groups, and can be identified by one or more words or symbols. 

## Principle:

- Refers to a statement that describes what should be done (e.g. laws, policies, etc.), what is generally the case (e.g. generalizations), and underlying assumptions. 

## Facts:

- Refers to a statement presented without supporting evidence. Examples might include symbols, measurements, dates associated with events, and experimental results. 

## Classification:

- Refers to the grouping of a set of specimens into classes or categories, based on some criteria.
