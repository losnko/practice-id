# Good Vs. Bad Design: 
---

Design can be evaluated by clarity, consistency, and understanding the user's goals. Designers should stay consistent with their content, ensuring that the information is legible and stays within the topic category. 

### Avoid Ambiguity:
Use clear information displays and test your design to ensure that all users understand the display in the same way. Where ambiguity is avoidable, use standards or conventions to resolve it, and stay uniform. 

### Be Consistent:
Place information and controls in consistent locations. Controls and data displays that serve the same function on different pages should be placed in the same position on each page on which they appear. They should also stay a consistent colour, text font, shading, and so on. This consistency allows users to spot and recognize them quickly. 

### Understand Users Goals:
Users come to a system with goals they wish to achieve. Designers should understand those potential goals. Realize that usersâ€™ goals may vary and that their goals strongly influence what they perceive. Ensure that at every point in an interaction, the information users need is available, prominent and maps clearly to a possible user goal, so users will use the information.
