# Requirements
Measuring usability begins with understanding the requirements of the product or service being tested. This involves gathering information on user needs, tasks, and goals, and using this information to inform the design of the product or service. By clearly defining the requirements upfront, usability testing can be focused on measuring how well the product or service meets these requirements.
