# Tree Testing
Tree testing is a usability testing method that involves testing the organization and labelling of a website or application without the distraction of visual design. This approach helps to identify areas where users may struggle to find information or navigate the site.

Measuring usability with tree testing involves evaluating how confidently users are able to complete tasks using the site structure and labelling, and identifying areas where improvements can be made.

For example, testing the navigation of a cooking website by asking users to find a specific recipe using only the site's navigation structure.

The metric being measured is: the number of steps it takes for users to find the recipe and the number of incorrect turns they make along the way.

This metric relates to measuring usability and evaluating the information architecture by: testing the effectiveness of the site's organization of recipe categories and subcategories.
