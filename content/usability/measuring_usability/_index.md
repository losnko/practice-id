# Measuring usability
---
People seem to think of the user experience can’t be measured or quantified. It can, and the tools for measuring it are metrics like the following:

{{< blockquote source="Measuring the User Experience, 2013, Tullis & Albert" >}} "Success rates, times, number of mouse clicks or keystrokes, self-reported ratings of frustration or delight, and even the number of visual fixations on a link on a webpage are all examples of UX metrics and these metrics can give you invaluable insight into the user experience". {{< /blockquote >}}

- Can users use their smartphone successfully to find the nearest doctor that’s in their health plan?
- How long does it take users to make a flight reservation using a travel website?
- How many errors do users make in trying to log in to a new system?
- How many users are successful in using their new tablet application to instruct their digital video recorder to record all episodes of their favourite TV show?
- How many users get into a new “destination-based” elevator without first choosing their desired floor, only to discover there are no floor buttons?
- How many users get frustrated trying to read the tiny serial number hidden under the battery of their new mobile phone when registering for service?
- How many users are delighted by how easy it was to assemble their new bookcase that came with wordless instructions?

These are all examples of behaviours and attitudes that can be measured. Some may be easier to measure than others, but they can all be measured.


# Requirements
---
Measuring usability begins with understanding the requirements of the product or service being tested. This involves gathering information on user needs, tasks, and goals, and using this information to inform the design of the product or service.

By clearly defining the requirements upfront, usability testing can be focused on measuring how well the product or service meets these requirements.
