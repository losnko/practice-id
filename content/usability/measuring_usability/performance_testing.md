# Performance Testing: 
Performance testing is a usability testing method that involves testing how well a product or service performs under different conditions. This includes testing speed, responsiveness, and stability. Measuring usability with performance testing involves identifying the most important performance metrics for the product or service and testing how well it performs under different conditions.

For example, testing a mobile game performance by measuring the time it takes for the game to load on different devices and network speeds.

The metric being measured is: the load time and stability of the game across different platforms.

This metric relates to measuring usability and evaluating the information architecture by: testing the efficiency and effectiveness of the code and underlying technology that powers the game.
