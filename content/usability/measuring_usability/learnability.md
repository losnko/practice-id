# Learnability: 
Learnability is a measure of how easy it is for users to learn how to use a product or service. Measuring learnability involves testing how quickly users are able to complete tasks with minimal training or guidance. This can include testing how easily users are able to navigate the interface, understand terminology, and complete common tasks. By measuring learnability, designers can identify areas where the product or service can be made more intuitive and easy to use. 

For example, to test a new email client, users are asked to compose and send an email using the interface without any prior training or guidance.

The metric being measured is: the time it takes for users to complete the task and the number of errors they make along the way.

This metric relates to measuring usability and evaluating the information architecture by: testing the intuitiveness of the interface elements, design, and labelling of different features.
