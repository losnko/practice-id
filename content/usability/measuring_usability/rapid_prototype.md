# Rapid Prototype
Rapid prototyping is a design technique that involves quickly creating a low-fidelity version of a product or service to test usability. This approach allows designers to gather feedback early in the design process and make iterative improvements before investing in more expensive design work. Measuring usability with rapid prototyping involves testing how well users are able to interact with the prototype and identifying areas where improvements can be made. 

For example, creating a low-fidelity prototype of a new e-commerce website wherein users are asked to complete a typical shopping task, such as finding and purchasing a specific product. 

The metric being measured is: the time it takes for users to complete the task and the number of errors they make along the way.

This metric relates to measuring usability and evaluating the information architecture by: testing the effectiveness of the site's organization and labelling of product categories and pages.
