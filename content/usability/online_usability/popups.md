# Pop-Ups
Pop-ups provide users with additional information, feedback, or guidance, and can be triggered by specific actions or events. For example, a pop-up could be used to provide a user with a confirmation message after completing an action, such as submitting a form. Pop-ups can also be used to provide users with helpful tips or guidance on how to navigate a website or app.
