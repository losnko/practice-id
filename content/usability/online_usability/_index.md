# Online Usability
---

To ensure online usability, website designers need to incorporate familiar conventions such as search, navigation, tables of contents and indexes.

While website indexes may not need to be as extensive as their print counterparts, they still provide overviews, perspectives, and efficient navigation that readers will appreciate.

# Navigation
---
Navigation plays a crucial role in online usability. Wayfinding, a concept in navigation, has four core components: orientation, route decisions, mental mapping, and closure.

Orientation helps users understand where they are, route decisions help users find the way to where they want to go, mental mapping helps users track where they have been and predict where they should go next, and closure helps users recognize when they have arrived at the right place.

### Navigational Systems

There are four types of navigational systems:

Global
: Global navigation systems are intended to be present on every page or screen in the information environment.

Local
: Local navigation systems complement global ones and allow users to explore the immediate area where they are.

Contextual
: Contextual navigation systems occur in the context of the content being presented and support associative learning by allowing users to explore the relationships between items.

Supplemental
: Supplemental navigation systems, such as sitemaps, give the reader an overview of the site contents. Site maps come in two varieties: graphic diagrams that use the "map" metaphor and organized list links to major pages within the site[^1]

### Types of Navigation Bars

Horizontal versus vertical navigation systems

Horizontal
: Immediately available

Horizontal
: Sometimes need a second bar at bottom of page

Vertical
: Grid layout. Makes the navigation secondary to the main information

Vertical
: Can accommodate a greater number of links than horizontal
: Pop-up navigation systems
: JavaScript navigation menus

Image Maps
: buttons, colours, roll-overs, icons

# Images
---

Images convey information quickly and effectively, and can be used to supplement or replace text-based content.

For example, an image could be used to represent a product or service, allowing users to quickly identify and understand what is being offered.

Images can also be used to break up large blocks of text, making content more visually appealing and easier to read.

# Pop-Ups
---
Pop-ups provide users with additional information, feedback, or guidance, and can be triggered by specific actions or events.

For example, a pop-up could be used to provide a user with a confirmation message after completing an action, such as submitting a form.

{{< alert type="info" >}} Pop-ups can also be used to provide users with helpful tips or guidance within a page, website or app. {{< /alert >}}
