### Navigation

Navigation plays a crucial role in online usability. Wayfinding, a concept in navigation, has four core components: orientation, route decisions, mental mapping, and closure.

Orientation helps users understand where they are, route decisions help users find the way to where they want to go, mental mapping helps users track where they have been and predict where they should go next, and closure helps users recognize when they have arrived at the right place.

### Navigational Systems

There are four types of navigational systems:

Global
: Global navigation systems are intended to be present on every page or screen in the information environment.

Local
: Local navigation systems complement global ones and allow users to explore the immediate area where they are.

Contextual
: Contextual navigation systems occur in the context of the content being presented and support associative learning by allowing users to explore the relationships between items.

Supplemental
: Supplemental navigation systems, such as sitemaps, give the reader an overview of the site contents. Site maps come in two varieties: graphic diagrams that use the "map" metaphor and organized list links to major pages within the site[^1]
