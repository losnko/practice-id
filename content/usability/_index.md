Usability refers to the ease with which users can access and interact with a website or application to achieve their desired goals. It encompasses factors such as ease of navigation, clarity of content, and overall user experience. Usability is a critical aspect of information architecture as it directly affects user satisfaction, engagement, and retention. A usable information architecture is one that is designed with the user in mind, making it easy for them to find what they are looking for and accomplish their tasks efficiently and effectively.
