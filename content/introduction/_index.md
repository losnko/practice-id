# Information architecture
---
In a digital world where we are overloaded with all the information we could want at our fingertips, it can be overwhelming to try and sort through it all. Information architecture is the solution to that problem.

Similar to IT, people often don’t think about information architecture *until* it’s done poorly. Good information architecture means a user is easily able to navigate a website, app, or skim a document to find important information.

While bad information architecture can leave a user staring blankly at a wall of text, or leaving a website when they can’t find the information or service they are looking for.

## What is information architecture?

---

Information architecture is a system to label and organize information in a way that makes sense to users, so they can navigate and find information. It covers a broad range of topics and mediums to combat information overload and navigational concerns.

Information architecture is used to structure the information in a way that the end user gets the simplest experience, and when done well should seem intuitive.

On documents, it should allow the reader to skim headings and be able to understand the key findings or message the designer wants them to know. In a digital space, information architecture should allow the user to navigate and find what they are looking for on websites and apps without getting lost or frustrated.

## Information architecture is concerned with:

**Users**
  - Who is the audience, what are their needs, what is the user experience?
  - Audience, tasks, needs, information-seeking behavior, experience


**Context**
  - What is the environment, resources, and constraints on the project, as well as the broader societal context?
  - Business goals, funding, politics, culture, technology, resources, and constraints


**Content**
  - What is the information, data, objectives that need to be shown to the user?
  - Document/data types, content objects, volume, existing structure

By looking at these three factors, information architecture can be used to organize the information required, to get the best user experience and convey information through design. In all forms of user experience, information architecture is essential, and without it the user experience can be miserable.
