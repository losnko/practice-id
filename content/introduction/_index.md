# Information architecture
---
In a digital world where we are overloaded with all the information we could want at our fingertips, it can be overwhelming to try and sort through it all. Information architecture is the solution to that problem.

Similar to IT, people often don’t think about information architecture unless it’s done badly. Good information architecture means a user is easily able to navigate a website, app, or skim a document to find important information. While bad information architecture can leave a user staring blankly at a wall of text, or leaving a website when they can’t find the information or service they are looking for.

In this text we will walk you through an introduction to the main principles of information architecture, the framework that should be utilized when structuring information for users, some examples of good and bad information architecture, and links to additional resources for those who wish to learn more.

We hope this guide can help readers recognize how information architecture is utilized in the world around them. And we hope that once readers finish this text they’ll be able to create documents, websites, and applications that users can easily understand and navigate.

## What is information architecture?

Information architecture is a system to label and organize information in a way that makes sense to users, so they can navigate and find information.

- Content: What is the information, data, objectives that need to be shown to the user?

- Users: Audience, tasks, needs, information-seeking behavior, experience
- Content: Document/data types, content objects, volume, existing structure
- Context: Business goals, funding, politics, culture, technology, resources, and constraints

By looking at these three factors, information architecture can be used to organize the information required, to get the best user experience and convey information through design. In any form of user experience, information architecture is essential, and without it the user experience can be miserable.
