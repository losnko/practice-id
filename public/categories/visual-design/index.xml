      <description>Designing With Colour # Colour Contrast: # Our visual system combines the signals from retinal cone cells to produce three colour-opponent channels:
red-green, yellow-blue, and black-white. The colours that people can distinguish easiest are those that cause a strong signal (positive or negative). Not surprisingly, those colours are red, green, yellow, blue, black, and white. All other colour cause signals on more than one colour channel, causing our visual system to struggle to distinguish between them as quickly as the listed six colours.</description>

      <description>Readability of Content: # Unfamiliar/Uncommon Vocabulary: # Use vocabulary that readers are familiar with and don’t disrupt the flow of freaking - stick to words that are easy to understand.
Difficult Script/Typefaces: # Fonts with minimal spacing or difficult shapes make it difficult to recognize - stick to simple, easy-to-read fonts.
Tiny Fonts: # Fonts that are too small can cause the readers’ visual system to be unable to read the content - stick to a font size that is appropriate for all audiences.</description>

      <description>Visual Design: # When designing applications, websites, or any type of display of content, it is important to consider the readability, colour scheme, vocabulary, font types, text alignment, etc. The main goal of a designer should always be to support reading and understand that skilled reading is based on feature, character, and word recognition. To provide legibility for all users’, designers should be conscious of the following:</description>

      <description>Good Vs. Bad Design: # Design can be evaluated by clarity, consistency, and understanding the user&amp;rsquo;s goals. Designers should stay consistent with their content, ensuring that the information is legible and stays within the topic category.
Avoid Ambiguity: # Use clear information displays and test your design to ensure that all users understand the display in the same way. Where ambiguity is avoidable, use standards or conventions to resolve it, and stay uniform.</description>
